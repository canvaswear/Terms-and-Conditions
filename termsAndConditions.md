**Account Suspension**

Canvas Wear reserves the right to suspend, pause, or close your account without prior notice if we suspect, at our discretion, any misuse including, but not limited to: (1) any illegal activities or money laundering through your account; (2) submission of false identification or information; (3) engagement in fraudulent activities; (4) acquiring art or NFTs through unauthorized means; (5) use of bots or automation for any site activity; (6) facilitating or soliciting transactions of regulated financial products without authorization; or (7) breaches of our Terms of Use.

In cases where there's a reasonable belief of engagement in prohibited activities, Canvas Wear may confiscate related digital assets or custom art merchandise and void such transactions.

**Account Closure**

You can choose to close your Canvas Wear account at any time. Closing your account doesn't negate previously incurred rights and obligations. Closure may require settling all open transactions and providing directions for transferring remaining assets. You're accountable for all costs related to account closure. If closure costs exceed your account balance, you're responsible for the difference. Accounts cannot be closed to evade fee payments.

**Communication**

Canvas Wear will communicate with you via email for promotional reasons and for transaction-related updates. This includes newsletters, special offers, and updates on your artwork sales or purchases. Opting out of promotional communications is possible at any time, but transactional updates are essential for your engagement with the platform.

**Profile Information**

Canvas Wear allows artists and supporters to create profiles to post personal information, link other sites, and showcase their art and NFTs ("Profile Information"). Any Profile Information you provide is non-confidential and must comply with our Terms of Use. While not actively monitored, we reserve the right to remove Profile Information that violates our Terms or to prevent fraudulent activity.

**Artist Content**

As an artist on Canvas Wear, you can publish content and mint your artwork into NFTs or prepare them for custom art apparel. You are responsible for ensuring your content does not infringe on third-party rights and complies with legal standards. Canvas Wear may remove content that violates our policies or terms.

Canvas Wear is dedicated to creating a respectful, safe environment and prohibits content that promotes unlawful acts or targets individuals or groups based on protected characteristics.

**Artist Licenses**

By submitting content to Canvas Wear, artists grant us and our affiliates the right to use, reproduce, modify, and display their content for service provision.

Artists also grant us the right to use their name and image for promotional purposes, ensuring that their art and stories reach a wider audience.

**Artist Representations & Warranties**

Artists guarantee they have the right to all content posted, ensuring it doesn't infringe on any laws or third-party rights. Artists commit to providing original, respectful content and complying with all applicable laws and standards. Canvas Wear promotes a platform of integrity and creativity, ensuring artists' work is showcased in the best light.

**Artwork Ownership and Custody**

At Canvas Wear, while you engage in selling or purchasing artwork, the ownership rights of any artwork, whether as NFTs or associated with custom art apparel, remain yours. We facilitate transactions but do not claim ownership of the artworks or NFTs. We commit to not leveraging your art for our gain without explicit consent or legal requirement. As the artist, you bear all risks related to the value of your art and NFTs.

We may offer custodial services for NFTs or partner with Third-Party Custodians to ensure the safety and security of your digital assets. In doing so, we aim to employ the highest standards of care, without establishing a fiduciary relationship with you. These services are meant to safeguard your NFTs without asserting control over the creative content they represent.

Our custodial services are designed to support the integrity and functionality of your artwork on our platform, without extending to the management of physical merchandise or the actual art files. While we strive to maintain access to your digital art, we are not responsible for data preservation beyond our control. The legal and financial responsibilities tied to artwork and NFTs are complex and may vary by jurisdiction; we advise artists and collectors to be aware of their rights and obligations.

Artwork and NFTs under our custody will be managed with care, aligning with the overall provisions of our Terms of Use. Canvas Wear acknowledges the evolving legal landscape regarding digital assets and commits to adapt and inform our community of any significant legal implications that might affect their art and transactions on our platform.

For the Terms of Sale and Intellectual Property sections, incorporating the specific elements of Canvas Wear's operations and its focus on art and apparel, the text could be adapted as follows:

**Terms of Sale**

By engaging with Canvas Wear, either by placing an order, making a bid, or using any other service offered through our platform, you're making a binding commitment to participate in a transaction. This commitment becomes confirmed and finalized once the transaction is completed, and a confirmation notification is displayed on our platform.

Please note, all sales are final except where required by law to offer refunds or returns. Purchasing artwork or custom art apparel from Canvas Wear grants you ownership of the physical or digital item but does not automatically transfer copyright or other intellectual property rights of the artwork itself unless explicitly stated by the artist or Canvas Wear.

Artists and publishers on Canvas Wear may offer additional benefits or items ("Additional Items") with their art. These are provided directly by the artist or publisher, and Canvas Wear is not responsible for the delivery or quality of these Additional Items.

Canvas Wear facilitates payments on behalf of sellers, acting as a limited agent solely for the purpose of payment processing. It's important to understand that by making or receiving payments through Canvas Wear, you agree to our fee structure and authorize us to deduct these fees from transactions.

**Intellectual Property**

Canvas Wear, along with its content, features, and services, including all designs, text, images, and the selection and arrangement thereof, is protected by intellectual property laws.

**Risks**

When engaging with Canvas Wear, it's important to understand the inherent risks:

Market Volatility: The value of digital assets, including NFTs and custom art apparel, can fluctuate widely and may be subject to market trends.

Regulatory Uncertainty: Changes in laws and regulations can impact the trading, valuation, and legality of digital assets and NFTs.

Irreversible Transactions: Transactions on the blockchain are final. Errors or fraud may lead to irreversible losses.

Non-Legal Tender: NFTs and digital assets are not government-backed currencies. Their value is market-driven.

Fraud and Security Risks: The digital nature of NFTs may increase susceptibility to fraud and cyberattacks. We strive to ensure platform security, but it's crucial to be vigilant.

Ownership Rights: Purchasing an NFT or custom art apparel may not grant ownership of the underlying artwork. Understand the rights associated with each purchase.

Off-Chain Risks: Artwork associated with NFTs is often stored off-chain and may be at risk of becoming inaccessible or altered.

Dependency on Third Parties: Canvas Wear might integrate with third-party services for transaction facilitation, which could affect service accessibility and reliability.

You're responsible for assessing these risks. Canvas Wear offers guidance but not investment advice. Your use of our platform is at your own discretion and risk.

**Third Parties**

Canvas Wear utilizes third-party platforms for enhanced service functionality, including but not limited to payment processing and NFT transactions. While we aim to select reputable partners, we do not control these third parties. It's essential to review their terms and privacy policies as their practices may differ from ours. Your interactions with third parties, facilitated through our platform, are governed by their respective terms.

Canvas Wear provides third-party links for convenience without endorsement. We advise caution and due diligence when navigating away from our platform.

For specific functionalities, you may need to engage with platforms like Dwolla for payment processing. By using such services, you agree to their terms and accept that Canvas Wear shares the necessary information to facilitate your account management and transactions. Canvas Wear is committed to providing support for activities related to these third-party services.

Contact Information: For any queries or support, please reach out to us at <andrew@canvas-wear.com>.

**External and Publisher Projects**

Canvas Wear encourages a diverse range of artwork, allowing for the listing, display, purchase, and sale of NFTs directly by artists ("Publisher Projects"). Canvas Wear reserves the right to set and enforce criteria for these projects to ensure compliance with our Terms of Use and overall platform standards.

Buyers of Publisher and External Projects: Purchases from Publisher or External Projects occur between you and the seller directly, not Canvas Wear. We make no claims about the condition, authenticity, or legality of such NFTs, which are bought "as is."

**Disclaimers**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CANVAS WEAR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL LIMIT LIABILITY FOR FRAUD, DEATH, BODILY INJURY, OR OTHER ACTS THAT CANNOT LEGALLY BE LIMITED.

Canvas Wear Parties will have control over the defense or settlement of these claims, at their discretion. This indemnification is in addition to any other indemnities agreed upon in written agreements between you and Canvas Wear.

**Governing Law These Terms of Use**

Your use of Canvas Wear, your rights and obligations, and all actions contemplated by, arising out of, or related to these Terms of Use shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming, as if these Terms of Use are a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within the State of Wyoming. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF CANVAS WEAR AS CONTEMPLATED BY THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF WYOMING AND BE SUBJECT TO THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF WYOMING WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PROVISIONS.

**Dispute Resolution**

Please carefully read this arbitration agreement, as it requires you and Canvas Wear to resolve disputes through binding arbitration instead of court litigation. This agreement limits the ways you or Canvas Wear can seek relief from each other.

Both parties agree that any controversy, claim, or dispute arising from or related to these Terms of Use, or your relationship with Canvas Wear—whether past, present, or future—will be settled exclusively through binding arbitration in the county where you reside, or another mutually agreed location, which may include remote video conference arbitration conducted in English. This process will be administered by an agreed-upon arbitration service and governed by its rules. Both parties agree to resolve any disputes regarding the arbitration agreement's scope or any specific dispute's arbitrability through arbitration according to this section. Arbitrators can grant all necessary declaratory and injunctive relief but only to the extent required for the individual party's claim. Both parties commit to maintaining the confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings.

This arbitration agreement extends to disputes that might involve other parties alongside Canvas Wear and covers any disputes related to these Terms of Use or any other agreement with Canvas Wear, regardless of Canvas Wear's involvement as a named party. Any co-defendant in such cases is entitled to enforce this arbitration agreement.

The arbitrator has the authority to issue any legal or equitable remedies that a court could, based on the individual case and claims made, but may not award punitive or exemplary damages unless the law allows.

This agreement acknowledges the transaction's interstate nature, and thus it is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), which will override any state laws where applicable.

Before seeking arbitration, the parties agree to try resolving disputes informally, which can often lead to quick and mutually beneficial outcomes. This involves sending a detailed Notice of Dispute to the other party, engaging in good-faith negotiations, and possibly discussing the dispute over the phone to reach a resolution before initiating arbitration. Compliance with these preliminary steps is a prerequisite for starting arbitration, and failure to fully comply will result in dismissal of the arbitration claim.

In the event arbitration proceeds, it will be conducted under the agreed arbitration service's rules, with certain specified exceptions to accommodate the unique aspects of this agreement and ensure a fair and efficient resolution process.

If you and Canvas Wear do not come to an agreement on a claim within 60 days after receiving a Demand Notice, either you or Canvas Wear may begin an arbitration process. However, if either party submits an incomplete Dispute Notice, the 60-day timeline only starts after a complete Dispute Notice is received. Similarly, if a telephone discussion is requested by either party, the 60-day period commences following the conversation. The statute of limitations and any deadlines for filing fees will be paused while both parties engage in these preliminary dispute resolution steps.

In the event a dispute goes to arbitration, you and Canvas Wear consent to adhere to the standard rules and procedures of a mutually agreed upon arbitration organization, barring certain exceptions:

\- Arbitration will be executed by a single impartial arbitrator.

\- Both parties will be responsible for their own legal fees, costs, and expenses unless the arbitrator decides that legal remedies are warranted under applicable law or finds that any claim, counterclaim, or defense was frivolous or for an improper purpose, in line with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).

\- All arbitration submissions must meet the integrity criteria set out in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which permits penalties for submissions made with improper intentions, such as to harass or needlessly inflate litigation costs.

\- The arbitrator is empowered to issue discovery orders allowing the parties sufficient preparation for their claims and defenses, aiming to keep arbitration swift and effective. Notably, depositions of high-ranking officers from either party are restricted unless it’s shown they possess unique, indispensable knowledge not attainable through less intrusive means.

\- For cases where 25 or more similar arbitration claims are filed against either party or associated entities by the same or coordinated legal representatives ("Mass Filing"), specific procedures will apply:

\- The dispute will be subject to NAM’s Mass Filing Rules if considered part of a Mass Filing by NAM.

\- A bellwether process will determine a fair resolution for all claims in the Mass Filing. NAM will select 15 arbitration demands to proceed first. While these Bellwether Arbitrations are ongoing, no other claims from the Mass Filing may proceed or require filing fees. The statute of limitations for any claim within the Mass Filing pauses when the initial Dispute Notice is sent.

\- After concluding the Bellwether Arbitrations, all remaining claims from the Mass Filing enter a global mediation phase. If unresolved within 30 days, these claims will individually proceed under NAM’s standard rules.

Both you and Canvas Wear commit to respecting all decisions and awards from such proceedings, understanding they are final and appealable only under the Federal Arbitration Act.

For immediate judicial relief related to these Terms or associated disputes, both parties agree to restrict court interventions to those expressly permitted, understanding that breach of this agreement incurs responsibility for the opposing party’s legal fees.

Notwithstanding the preference for arbitration, claims fitting for small claims court may proceed in that venue, with the understanding that escalation to higher courts brings those claims under arbitration’s purview.

Both parties also agree to pursue any court enforcement of arbitration awards within the agreed jurisdiction, waiving any venue objections.

All disputes, claims, or controversies are to be settled individually through arbitration or court, explicitly excluding class actions or collective arbitrations/litigations, with the understanding that the arbitration or tribunal cannot consolidate multiple parties’ claims or oversee any form of collective proceeding.

Should any part of this Arbitration Agreement be deemed unenforceable, the rest remains effective. If class or representative action provisions are found unenforceable, such actions may proceed in court only to the necessary extent, with all other disputes remaining bound to individual arbitration.

This dispute resolution section is crafted to expedite and minimize the cost of resolving any issues described herein, serving as the basis to pause or dismiss court actions related to such disputes.

This Terms of Use document is officially recognized and admissible in legal or administrative processes.

**Security Interest**

By engaging with Canvas Wear, you agree to provide a security interest in your account, which encompasses any NFTs it may contain, as collateral against any debts, dues, or liabilities you might owe to Canvas Wear or any related entities. This encompasses a broad spectrum of obligations, whether they're secured or unsecured, personal or joint, including those arising from various transactions or agreements with Canvas Wear or its affiliates.

Canvas Wear reserves the right to offset or extract from your account, including any NFTs, to settle any obligations, be they direct, indirect, or acquired, that you owe to Canvas Wear or its affiliates. This right supplements other measures Canvas Wear may employ to utilize assets or balances in your account to satisfy your financial commitments to Canvas Wear or its affiliates, as outlined in these Terms of Use.

Your agreement to these Terms of Use is interpreted as your explicit consent for Canvas Wear to assert a security interest or exercise a right of setoff in accordance with relevant laws governing your account. Should legal provisions limit our capacity to act on these rights, or if your account is safeguarded against seizure, you hereby relinquish such legal protections to the fullest extent contractually possible.

**Termination**

Canvas Wear reserves the right to terminate your access or use of its platform, services, or website at any time, without prior notice, at our sole discretion. You acknowledge that Canvas Wear will not be liable or owe obligations to you in the event of such termination.

**Severability**

Should any portion of these Terms of Use be deemed invalid or unenforceable, such portion will be considered independent from the rest, leaving the remaining provisions valid and enforceable. The invalidity or unenforceability of any part will not affect the rest of these Terms of Use.

**Entire Agreement**

The entirety of your agreement with Canvas Wear concerning your use of its services is encapsulated within these Terms of Use, overriding any previous discussions, agreements, or understandings, regardless of their nature (including previous versions of these Terms of Use). These Terms of Use are designed solely for the benefit of the parties involved, not to provide rights to any third parties.

**Survival**

Upon the termination or expiry of these Terms of Use, you acknowledge that certain provisions will remain in effect, ensuring their enforceability beyond the duration of these Terms.
